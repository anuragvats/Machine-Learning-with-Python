Here‚Äôs a **step-by-step execution plan** to stop spam calls from competitors abusing your business number. This includes tools, scripts, and workflows to implement immediately:

---

### **Phase 1: Immediate Blocking of Spam Calls**
**Goal**: Stop ongoing spam attacks and protect your team‚Äôs workflow.

#### **Step 1: Activate Carrier-Level Spam Filters**
- **Action**:  
  Contact your telecom provider (e.g., Airtel, Jio, Verizon) and request:  
  - **STIR/SHAKEN Protocol** (verifies caller authenticity).  
  - **Custom Blocklist** for numbers/IPs used by competitors.  
  - **Geofencing** to allow calls only from regions where you operate.  
- **Script**:  
  *‚ÄúHi, I‚Äôm receiving spam calls from dynamically changing numbers and IPs. Can you enable STIR/SHAKEN and block calls from [specific regions/IPs]?‚Äù*  

#### **Step 2: Switch to a Virtual Phone System**
- **Tools**: [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com), [Plivo](https://www.plivo.com), or [CallRail](https://www.callrail.com).  
- **Action**:  
  1. Buy a virtual number from Twilio.  
  2. Route calls to your team‚Äôs phones via Twilio.  
  3. Use Twilio‚Äôs **Spam Detection API** to auto-block spam calls.  
- **Code Example** (Twilio webhook):  
  ```python
  from twilio.twiml.voice_response import VoiceResponse

  def handle_call(request):
      resp = VoiceResponse()
      if request.form['From'] in spam_list:  # Add your spam number/IP list
          resp.reject()
      else:
          resp.dial("+1XXXYYYZZZZ")  # Your team‚Äôs number
      return str(resp)
  ```

### **Phase 2: Protect Your Number on the Website**
**Goal**: Prevent competitors from scraping/abusing your number.

#### **Step 3: Replace the Public Number with a Contact Form**

  1. Remove the phone number from your website.  
  2. Add a contact form with **CAPTCHA** (e.g., Google reCAPTCHA).

#### **Step 4: Use Dynamic Number Insertion (DNI)**  
- **Tools**: [CallRail](https://www.callrail.com), [Invoca](https://www.invoca.com).  
- **Action**:  
  1. Integrate CallRail with your website.  
  2. Assign unique numbers to visitors based on:  
     - **Source** (e.g., Google Ads vs. spammy referrals).  
     - **IP Reputation** (block high-risk IPs).  
  3. Track and block numbers receiving spam calls.

  2. Set rules to block:  
     - Calls lasting **<5 seconds**.  
     - Numbers flagged as spam by Truecaller‚Äôs database.  

#### **Step 6: Set Up an IVR System**
- **Tools**: [Aircall](https://aircall.io), [Twilio Studio](https://www.twilio.com/studio).  
- **Action**:  
  1. Create an IVR menu:  
     *‚ÄúPress 1 for Sales, Press 2 for Support.‚Äù*  
  2. Route spam calls to a silent queue or disconnect them.  
- **Example IVR Workflow**:  
  ```plaintext

  If input = 1 ‚Üí Route to team  
  ```
